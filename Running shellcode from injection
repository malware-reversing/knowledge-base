A lame way to inject shellcode into a file without requiring external tools besides CFF

CFF -> Section Headers -> Add Section (File Data) -> Select shellcode file
Modify header characteristics to equal .text so it's runnable
Optional Header -> DllCharacteristics -> DLL can remove -> Uncheck
Optional Header -> AddressOfEntryPoint -> Set to Virtual Address of created Section Header
Now we've "backdoored" the executable to just run our shellcode so we don't even need to inject it to analyze
