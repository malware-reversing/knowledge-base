PowerShell Command (HTTPS Listener)
---
powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <xxx>
where <xxx> is a long base64 string
We can basically decode the entire thing in CyberChef
-base64 decode the base64 string
-remove null bytes (unicode)
-pull out the base64 (regex: [0-za-bA-Z+/]{40,})
---use list matches instead of the default highlight matches to pull out the string
-base64 decode the base64 string
-gunzip
-pull out the base64 (regex: [0-za-bA-Z+/]{40,})
-base64 decode the base64 string
***at this point we have a powershell script (as usual). we see $var_code is a base64 string which needs to be decoded, then there is a for loop with "$var_code[$x] = $var_code[$x] -bxor 35"
******so for this CS version, the xor byte which is used is 35 (0x23)
-xor 35
-to hex: this is the shellcode (the c2 is actually visible as text near the end)
-scdbg does not work on this shellcode, there's a byte near the start which scdbg does not support
