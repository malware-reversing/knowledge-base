Windows -> Right click -> Properties -> Digital signatures -> Details -> View Certificate -> Details -> CRL Distribution Point
Access the distribution point to download the respective CRL file
Parse the file using openssl: "openssl crl -inform DER -text -noout -in xxx.crl"
Compare the file's certificate serial number against the CRL list of revoked serial numbers to check if revoked.

Newer method seems to be using OCSP, but this way works fine and seems easier at least for file-based certificates.
