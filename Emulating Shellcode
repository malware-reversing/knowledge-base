Pivoted on a PDB from a khRAT sample d36053ba10b392b30af087d4129644fda821a3f4b9b812796e97d72586c26b37
Seemed different but good for testing shellcode emulation anyway
"scdbg /f sample.exe /foff 0x11710"

Performing this emulation using scdbg allowed us to quickly check out the C2 IP and port
If we checked out the executable, we see that it:
---memcpy's shellcode into a variable
---creates heap, allocates heap
---qmemcpy the shellcode onto the heap
---runs the shellcode

So we know the address of the shellcode in IDA but IDA shows the virtual address of the shellcode whereas we need the file offset to run the scdbg emulator using the /foff parameter (or at least I don't know how else).
In order to find the file offset quickly, the lame but reliable way I use is not to convert the addressing but rather just search for the shellcode opcodes in a hex editor and get the file offset.
