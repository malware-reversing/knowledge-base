Multiple python files (python scripts, compiled python, compiled python dlls, etc) can be packaged into a single PyInstaller executable.
Easy way to recognize is that the files created will be all python files (.pyc, .pyd, etc) and created in %TEMP%\_meixxxxx\ (random number, see https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/operating-mode.html).
The PyInstaller install files are actually compressed in the PE overlay, together with the file names of the install files.

But Countercept actually glued together a decompiler from various tools (https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker) which can easily decompile the PyInstaller.
From there, the main file (the file which has an install manifest, no file extension, and probably same name as the PyInstaller file) contains the main compiled python code.
This compiled python code (together with the other .pyc files) are likely to be missing some headers (first 8 bytes), so just copy the first 8 bytes from another .pyc file in the "extracted" folder which the unpacker created into the main file. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8OtmBoCyw4)
From there, we can use a normal python decompiler such as "Easy Python Decompiler" (https://github.com/aliansi/Easy-Python-Decompiler-v1.3.2) to decompile the .pyc code (may have to add .pyc extension to the main file).
