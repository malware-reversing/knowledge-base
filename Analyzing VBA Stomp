pip install -U oletools (https://github.com/decalage2/oletools)
olevba file.xls
VBA Stomped code is detected and shown as well
If output is too long, pipe it or if pipe has encoding errors, simply change Command Prompt buffer settings: Right Click -> Properties -> Buffer Size=999

We can also see decompiled p-code which is even better than seeing ugly p-code using https://github.com/Big5-sec/pcode2code
pip install pcode2code -U
pcode2code file.xls
